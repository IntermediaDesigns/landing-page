What Will You Build?

You will be building a multi-section landing page. Often times, we don’t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API. To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu. Additionally, dynamically building the navigation is a great precursor to understanding the virtual DOM which you will experience when you begin working with JavaScript frameworks.

To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed should be differentiated in some way. Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll you to the appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump.

This may not sound like a lot, but there are a fair amount of moving pieces that rely on each other to work. You’ll need to plan out the logic of what you are trying to accomplish before you begin developing. If you find this process to be quick, there’s a list of additional functionality that you can add that all strive to improve the users’ experience.

Getting Started

Introduction

This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

Use the Starter Code or Start from Scratch?
If you'd like to start from scratch without any files, you are encouraged to do so! You learn the most by developing on your own! But, it can be a bit challenging to start from scratch, so we provide a starter project (i.e., a "skeleton") to use.

The starter code has a static, non-interactive version of the project so you can get a jump-start on development!
